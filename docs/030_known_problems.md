## Partial Combo support

`COMBO_ACTION` + `process_combo_event()` is only a supported API for QMK's combo feature.
See [official documentation](https://docs.qmk.fm/features/combo#examples)

Simple `COMBO()` are not supported yet


## Twice quantum key processing before users code

Then you press a key there are many layers involved in handling that press:
- quantum's process_record()
- keyboard's process_record_keyboard()
- users process_record_user() (the one we write in keymap.c)
- post user processing in keyboard layer
- post keyboard processing in quantum
- final decision to send a key press to OS

The problem is that sm_td suspends key handling execution in users layer and later emulates key pressing or releasing. The library uses quantum process_record() function to generate key presses and releases. So with single tap there will be such situation:

- user press a key
- quantum layer runs process_record() for press
- keyboard layer runs process_record_keyboard() for press
- user layer runs process_record_user() for press
- sm_td blocks further execution and nothing is sent to OS

- user release a key
- quantum layer runs process_record() for release
- keyboard layer runs process_record_keyboard() for release
- user layer runs process_record_user() for release
- sm_td interpret that as a tap, so it reruns process_record for press
  - quantum layer runs process_record() for press
  - keyboard layer runs process_record_keyboard() for press
  - user layer runs process_record_user() for press
  - sm_td passes exection since it recognized that as a tap
  - post user processing in keyboard layer for press
  - post keyboard processing in quantum for press
  - send a key press to OS
- sm_td passes release
- post user processing in keyboard layer for release
- post keyboard processing in quantum for release
- send a key release to OS

so as you see there is extra execution for process_record() and process_record_keyboard(). It's not big deal, if you don't user sm_td keys for anything else, I didn't notice any visible consequences for that behaviour. But there could be some side effects for core libraries (like caps word, i guess), so if you find any bugs here, please create an issue in github here
